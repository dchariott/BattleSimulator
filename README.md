# BattleSimulator
A class project using object-oriented principles to have two actors with different classes created and different moves. There was also the use of the Stack ADT and and Command Design Pattern to implement the ability to undo moves. Via the instructions recieved the program was coded to allow one to choose between having player 1 "attack" player 2, vice-versa, or undoing the last move. The move that the chose actor uses is selected at random, again following said instructions, so "attack" is used in the prior sentence because one could potentially have heal as a move which is not an attack.
